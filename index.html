    <h1>Favorite CMSC subject:</h1>
    <p>My favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 22 which is Object Oriented Programming. It was taught to us in the most exciting way by Sir Bulacs. His goals everyday day were not only to teach us the lessons but also to impart life lessons that we could use to make us wiser. The most fun part of the class was when we did our own implementation of Bomberman.</p>

    <h1>Favorite GE:</h1>
    <p>My favorite GE is Psychology 1. Psychology is one of my interests because I want to undestand how our mind works. There is so much to learn about the mysteries of the mind. When I took the subject, we went to Ocean Adventure in Subic to see the trained animals perform.</p>

    <h1>Favorite Programming Language:</h1>
    <p>Java is my programming language. I have learned using Java in my favorite subject which is CMSC 22. I love it because it is easy to use and I can code my interests using it. It is very exciting to make digital versions of real-life objects and make it work.</p>

    <h1>Favorite Food:</h1>
    <p>My mom always cooks spaghetti during my birthday that is why it is my favorite food. I love different kinds of pasta but the sweet filipino style is my favorite. With the combination of cheese, tomato sauce, hotdogs, meat and sugar, it sure makes my celebration more fun. My friends also like my mom's recipe </p>
